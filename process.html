        <h3>Our Process</h3>
        <p>At Verdant Fork, we define the heart of our operations through sustainability. We prioritize energy efficiency by utilizing low-energy LED lighting throughout our space, as well as embracing natural ventilation and lighting during brunch hours by opening windows, reducing our reliance on air conditioning. Verdant Forkâ€™s commitment further extends to responsible resource management through smart inventory practices, ensuring minimal food waste. Leftovers are donated to local organizations in order to support our community whilst reducing landfill contributions. By sourcing in-season produce and growing some of our own, our environmental footprint is lessened and freshness is promoted in every dish. Finally, Verdant Fork has eliminated single-use plastics, opting for sustainable alternatives such as bamboo and cornstarch-based bioplastics. 

            Verdant Fork's preparation process carries on these values. Our open kitchen layout allows you to see your meal being prepared with love in a well-maintained, sanitary environment. Composting and recycling stations are placed throughout our restaurant, supported by staff training and partnerships with local waste management to ensure proper efficient methods. By collaborating with local farms, we are able to provide seasonal ingredients through certified human suppliers. With our state-of-the-art water-efficient appliances and low-flow fixtures, we have successfully optimizing clean and sustainable water usable. 
            
            Together, our efforts work together to create a healthy, eco-friendly experience that serves individuals of all backgrounds. </p>
